1. Use hashclash to generate collision of two files with specified prefix ./hashclash/scripts/cpc.sh grade.txt grade2.txt
2. Hashes of generated files are the same and only the first three lines of the files are read.
3. We can check if the forged file will work by signing the original file with the clash suffix and verifying if the forged file matches the signature.
openssl dgst -md5 -sign cakeySec.pem -out grade2048.sign grade.txt.coll
openssl dgst -md5 -verify public_key2048.pem -signature grade2048.sign grade2.txt.coll
